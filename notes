### INITIAL SETUP :

1. Use the following to create a react app instantly:
    ```bash
    npx create-react-app . --template typescript
    ```
2. Delete all the default css files in src folder as we will be custom designing at the end.
3. Delete all the test files in src for now.
4. Keep all your images in a seperate folder in src.
5. Setup the required fonts by including the embed tag in head tag in index.html from google fonts website:
    ```html
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Catamaran:wght@100..900&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
    ```

### COMPONENTS :

1. Create a components folder in src.
2. Components are units of the front-end functionality (They are actually functions starting with capital letters), making it easier to replicate and containerize the front end code.
3. Export each component after defining them.
    ```typescript
    const QuestionCard = () => <div>Question Card</div>
    export default QuestionCard;
    ```

### CONNECTING TO AN API:

1. In this project, we are using open trivia API for generating questions. We generated an API url.
2. Create an API.ts file in src, where we make all the api calls and retrieve information
